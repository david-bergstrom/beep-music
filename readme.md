A stupid solution to playing midi files. I feel as if I should apologise, but I 
won't.

How to run:

```
sudo ./music.sh <path-to-midi-file>
```

If you are smart, maybe you can figure out a way to run the script without 
root. Really, you should not run scripts from the internet with sudo.. But I 
guess this script is pretty safe.

Thanks for your attention.
